## üëã Hi, I'm Gennie!

A powerful CLI assistant designed to support multiple models and profiles to suit your needs. Whether you're working on programming, researching movies, or diving into database management, I'm here to assist!

## üìÅ Profiles

![Profile Menu](docs/images/profile_menu.png)

**Profiles act like personal assistants.** Create profiles for different topics and switch between them effortlessly. For example, have a profile for:

- **Database Administrator**: Optimized suggestions for database queries.
- **Film Buff**: Recommendations and insights on movies.
- **Unit Testing**: Guidance on writing reliable unit tests.

Use `gennie profile` to manage your profiles or the `--profile` flag with the `ask` command.

**Profiles are cached for performance:**

- Set the environment variable `GINNIE_PROFILES_PATH` to customize your profile storage directory.
- Default location: `~/.config/gennie/profiles`
- Refresh your cached profiles with `gennie profile refresh`.

## ü§ñ Supported Models / AI Companies

![Models Menu](docs/images/model_menu.png)

**Explore multiple models at your fingertips!** Check and switch between them using `gennie model`, or with the `--model` flag in the `ask` command.

Current Models:

- [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/)
- [OpenAI's GPT-4 Mini](https://openai.com/)
- [Anthropic's Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/)

### Coming Soon:

- [Maritaca AI](https://maritaca.ai/)
- [Groq's Llama](https://www.groq.com/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

## Extra Features

### Follow-Up Questions

Enhance your queries with the `--followup` flag for related questions that build upon your previous interactions:

```bash
$ gennie ask "Create a list of the best movies of 2021"
$ gennie ask "Are there any movies in that list by Martin Scorcese?" --followup
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Without a follow-up, your chat history is cleared. Use `--followup` to maintain context or export your history with the `export` command.

### Export Chat History

Effortlessly save your chat interactions using the `export` command:

```bash
$ gennie ask "Create a list of the best movies of 2021"
$ gennie export chat_history.txt
```

### Append Files to Questions

Incorporate context by appending files to your queries using the `--append` flag:

```bash
$ gennie ask "Build me a unit test for" --append main.go
```

### Check Status

Keep track of your current model and profile with:

```bash
$ gennie status
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Using Go:

```bash
$ go install github.com/robertoseba/gennie@latest

If after installation you receive a `command not found` error, ensure that your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
